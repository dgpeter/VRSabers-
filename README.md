This is my way of exploring mirroring the motion from the controller of Oculus GO to another object in space.
Made as a precursor to my third year project which requires mirroring.
It contains to .apk files, saber1.apk is the up-to-date version of the project (contains post-processing stack + game play features), but it is taxing on the headset.
You can upload these apk's to your Oculus Go headset or other similar heedsets using the ADB driver.
